This application delivers a pre-project assessment built around the 5 Core Principles every app creator should evaluate before development begins: Manageability, Performance, Security, Upgradability, and User Experience.
It helps teams validate readiness, uncover risks early, and align architecture decisions before a project starts—so creators build the right thing, the right way, from day one.
